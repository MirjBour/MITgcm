CEOP

C CPP flags controlling particular source code features

C-- Forcing code options:

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
C Note: this should be a run-time option

C o Include/exclude Geothermal Heat Flux at the bottom of the ocean

C o Allow to account for heating due to friction (and momentum dissipation)

C o Allow mass source or sink of Fluid in the interior
C   (3-D generalisation of oceanic real-fresh water flux)

C o Include pressure loading code

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing fluxes code

C o Include/exclude balancing surface forcing relaxation code

C o Include/exclude checking for negative salinity

C-- Options to discard parts of the main code:

C o Exclude/allow external forcing-fields load
C   this allows to read & do simple linear time interpolation of oceanic
C   forcing fields, if no specific pkg (e.g., EXF) is used to compute them.

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code

C o Include/exclude sound speed calculation code
C o (Note that this is a diagnostic from Del Grasso algorithm, not derived from EOS)

C-- Vertical mixing code options:

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY

C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity

C o Allow latitudinally varying BryanLewis79 vertical diffusivity

C o Exclude/allow partial-cell effect (physical or enhanced) in vertical mixing
C   this allows to account for partial-cell in vertical viscosity and diffusion,
C   either from grid-spacing reduction effect or as artificially enhanced mixing
C   near surface & bottom for too thin grid-cell

C o Exclude/allow to use isotropic 3-D Smagorinsky viscosity as diffusivity
C   for tracers (after scaling by constant Prandtl number)

C-- Time-stepping code options:

C o Include/exclude combined Surf.Pressure and Drag Implicit solver code

C o Include/exclude Implicit vertical advection code

C o Include/exclude AdamsBashforth-3rd-Order code

C o Include/exclude Quasi-Hydrostatic Stagger Time-step AdamsBashforth code

C-- Model formulation options:

C o Allow/exclude "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   that ensures that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that grid-cell thickness (hFactors) varies with time
C o Disable code for rStar coordinate and/or code for Sigma coordinate
c#define DISABLE_RSTAR_CODE
c#define DISABLE_SIGMA_CODE

C o Include/exclude nonHydrostatic code

C o Include/exclude GM-like eddy stress in momentum code

C-- Algorithm options:

C o Include/exclude code for Non Self-Adjoint (NSA) conjugate-gradient solver

C o Include/exclude code for single reduction Conjugate-Gradient solver

C o Choices for implicit solver routines solve_*diagonal.F
C   The following has low memory footprint, but not suitable for AD
C   The following one suitable for AD but does not vectorize

C-- Retired code options:

C o ALLOW isotropic scaling of harmonic and bi-harmonic terms when
C   using an locally isotropic spherical grid with (dlambda) x (dphi*cos(phi))
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
C   The preferred method is specifying a value for viscAhGrid or viscA4Grid
C   in data which is then automatically scaled by the grid size;
C   the old method of specifying viscAh/viscA4 and this flag is provided
C   for completeness only (and for use with the adjoint).
c#define ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING

C o This flag selects the form of COSINE(lat) scaling of bi-harmonic term.
C *only for use on a lat-lon grid*
C   Has no effect if ISOTROPIC_COS_SCALING is undefined.
C   Has no effect on vector invariant momentum equations.
C   Setting this flag here affects both momentum and tracer equation unless
C   it is set/unset again in other header fields (e.g., GAD_OPTIONS.h).
C   The definition of the flag is commented to avoid interference with
C   such other header files.
c#define COSINEMETH_III

C o Use "OLD" UV discretisation near boundaries (*not* recommended)
C   Note - only works with pkg/mom_fluxform and "no_slip_sides=.FALSE."
C          because the old code did not have no-slip BCs

C o Use LONG.bin, LATG.bin, etc., initialization for ini_curviliear_grid.F
C   Default is to use "new" grid files (OLD_GRID_IO undef) but OLD_GRID_IO
C   is still useful with, e.g., single-domain curvilinear configurations.

C o Use old EXTERNAL_FORCING_U,V,T,S subroutines (for backward compatibility)

C-- Other option files:

C o Execution environment support options

C     *==========================================================*
C     | C preprocessor "execution environment" supporting        |
C     | flags. Use this file to set flags controlling the        |
C     | execution environment in which a model runs - as opposed |
C     | to the dynamical problem the model solves.               |
C     | Note: Many options are implemented with both compile time|
C     |       and run-time switches. This allows options to be   |
C     |       removed altogether, made optional at run-time or   |
C     |       to be permanently enabled. This convention helps   |
C     |       with the data-dependence analysis performed by the |
C     |       adjoint model compiler. This data dependency       |
C     |       analysis can be upset by runtime switches that it  |
C     |       is unable to recoginise as being fixed for the     |
C     |       duration of an integration.                        |
C     |       A reasonable way to use these flags is to          |
C     |       set all options as selectable at runtime but then  |
C     |       once an experimental configuration has been        |
C     |       identified, rebuild the code with the appropriate  |
C     |       options set at compile time.                       |

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C=== Macro related options ===
C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working set size.
C     However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades performance.
C     Enable to switch REAL4_IS_SLOW from genmake2 (with LET_RS_BE_REAL4):

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use D0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C=== IO related options ===
C--   Flag used to indicate whether Fortran formatted write
C     and read are threadsafe. On SGI the routines can be thread
C     safe, on Sun it is not possible - if you are unsure then
C     undef this option.

C--   Flag used to indicate whether Binary write to Local file (i.e.,
C     a different file for each tile) and read are thread-safe.

C--   Flag to turn off the writing of error message to ioUnit zero

C--   Alternative formulation of BYTESWAP, faster than
C     compiler flag -byteswapio on the Altix.

C--   Flag to turn on old default of opening scratch files with the
C     STATUS='SCRATCH' option. This method, while perfectly FORTRAN-standard,
C     caused filename conflicts on some multi-node/multi-processor platforms
C     in the past and has been replace by something (hopefully) more robust.

C--   Flag defined for eeboot_minimal.F, eeset_parms.F and open_copy_data_file.F
C     to write STDOUT, STDERR and scratch files from process 0 only.
C WARNING: to use only when absolutely confident that the setup is working
C     since any message (error/warning/print) from any proc <> 0 will be lost.

C=== MPI, EXCH and GLOBAL_SUM related options ===
C--   Flag turns off MPI_SEND ready_to_receive polling in the
C     gather_* subroutines to speed up integrations.

C--   Control MPI based parallel processing
CXXX We no longer select the use of MPI via this file (CPP_EEOPTIONS.h)
CXXX To use MPI, use an appropriate genmake2 options file or use
CXXX genmake2 -mpi .
CXXX #undef  ALLOW_USE_MPI

C--   Control use of communication that might overlap computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "non-blocking" sends and receives.
C--   Control use of communication that is atomic to computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "blocking" sends and receives.

C--   Control XY periodicity in processor to grid mappings
C     Note: Model code does not need to know whether a domain is
C           periodic because it has overlap regions for every box.
C           Model assume that these values have been
C           filled in some way.

C--   disconnect tiles (no exchange between tiles, just fill-in edges
C     assuming locally periodic subdomain)

C--   Always cumulate tile local-sum in the same order by applying MPI allreduce
C     to array of tiles ; can get slower with large number of tiles (big set-up)

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum without MPI allreduce call
C     but instead, explicit MPI send & recv calls. Expected to be slower.

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum on a single CPU
C     to eliminate tiling-dependent roundoff errors. Note: This is slow.

C=== Other options (to add/remove pieces of code) ===
C--   Flag to turn on checking for errors from all threads and procs
C     (calling S/R STOP_IF_ERROR) before stopping.

C--   Control use of communication with other component:
C     allow to import and export from/to Coupler interface.

C--   Activate some pieces of code for coupling to GEOS AGCM

C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally

C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C     Flag used to indicate which flavour of multi-threading
C     compiler directives to use. Only set one of these.
C     USE_SOLARIS_THREADING  - Takes directives for SUN Workshop
C                              compiler.
C     USE_KAP_THREADING      - Takes directives for Kuck and
C                              Associates multi-threading compiler
C                              ( used on Digital platforms ).
C     USE_IRIX_THREADING     - Takes directives for SGI MIPS
C                              Pro Fortran compiler.
C     USE_EXEMPLAR_THREADING - Takes directives for HP SPP series
C                              compiler.
C     USE_C90_THREADING      - Takes directives for CRAY/SGI C90
C                              system F90 compiler.






C--   Define the mapping for the _BARRIER macro
C     On some systems low-level hardware support can be accessed through
C     compiler directives here.

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_CRIT() and  END_CRIT() macros.
C     On some systems we simply execute this section only using the
C     master thread i.e. its not really a critical section. We can
C     do this because we do not use critical sections in any critical
C     sections of our code!

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_MASTER_SECTION() and
C     END_MASTER_SECTION() macros. These are generally implemented by
C     simply choosing a particular thread to be "the master" and have
C     it alone execute the BEGIN_MASTER..., END_MASTER.. sections.

CcnhDebugStarts
C      Alternate form to the above macros that increments (decrements) a counter each
C      time a MASTER section is entered (exited). This counter can then be checked in barrier
C      to try and detect calls to BARRIER within single threaded sections.
C      Using these macros requires two changes to Makefile - these changes are written
C      below.
C      1 - add a filter to the CPP command to kill off commented _MASTER lines
C      2 - add a filter to the CPP output the converts the string N EWLINE to an actual newline.
C      The N EWLINE needs to be changes to have no space when this macro and Makefile changes
C      are used. Its in here with a space to stop it getting parsed by the CPP stage in these
C      comments.
C      #define IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  N EWLINE      CALL BARRIER_MS(a)
C      #define ENDIF    CALL BARRIER_MU(a) N EWLINE        ENDIF
C      'CPP = cat $< | $(TOOLSDIR)/set64bitConst.sh |  grep -v '^[cC].*_MASTER' | cpp  -traditional -P'
C      .F.f:
C      $(CPP) $(DEFINES) $(INCLUDES) |  sed 's/N EWLINE/\n/' > $@
CcnhDebugEnds

C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working
C     set size. However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades
C     performance.
C- Note: global_sum/max macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete);
C  in addition, since only the R4 & R8 S/R are coded, GLOBAL RS & RL macros
C  enable to call the corresponding R4 or R8 S/R.



C- Note: a) exch macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete)
C        b) exch R4 & R8 macros are not practically used ; if needed,
C           will directly call the corrresponding S/R.

C--   Control use of JAM routines for Artic network (no longer supported)
C     These invoke optimized versions of "exchange" and "sum" that
C     utilize the programmable aspect of Artic cards.
CXXX No longer supported ; started to remove JAM routines.
CXXX #ifdef LETS_MAKE_JAM
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b)
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b ) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #endif

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use d0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C--   Substitue for 1.D variables
C     Sun compilers do not use 8-byte precision for literals
C     unless .Dnn is specified. CRAY vector machines use 16-byte
C     precision when they see .Dnn which runs very slowly!

C--   Set the format for writing processor IDs, e.g. in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file. The default of I9.9 should work for
C     a long time (until we will use 10e10 processors and more)



C o Include/exclude single header file containing multiple packages options
C   (AUTODIFF, COST, CTRL, ECCO, EXF ...) instead of the standard way where
C   each of the above pkg get its own options from its specific option file.
C   Although this method, inherited from ECCO setup, has been traditionally
C   used for all adjoint built, work is in progress to allow to use the
C   standard method also for adjoint built.
c#ifdef 
c# include "ECCO_CPPOPTIONS.h"
c#endif


C     Package-specific Options & Macros go here

C--   Write "text-plots" of certain fields in STDOUT for debugging.

C--   Allow sea-ice dynamic code.
C     This option is provided to allow use of TAMC
C     on the thermodynamics component of the code only.
C     Sea-ice dynamics can also be turned off at runtime
C     using variable SEAICEuseDYNAMICS.

C--   By default, the sea-ice package uses its own integrated bulk
C     formulae to compute fluxes (fu, fv, EmPmR, Qnet, and Qsw) over
C     open-ocean.  When this flag is set, these variables are computed
C     in a separate external package, for example, pkg/exf, and then
C     modified for sea-ice effects by pkg/seaice.

C--   This CPP flag has been retired.  The number of ice categories
C     used to solve for seaice flux is now specified by run-time
C     parameter SEAICE_multDim.
C     Note: be aware of pickup_seaice.* compatibility issues when
C     restarting a simulation with a different number of categories.
c#define SEAICE_MULTICATEGORY

C--   run with sea Ice Thickness Distribution (ITD);
C     set number of categories (nITD) in SEAICE_SIZE.h

C--   Since the missing sublimation term is now included
C     this flag is needed for backward compatibility

C--   Suspected missing term in coupled ocn-ice heat budget (to be confirmed)

C--   Default is constant seaice salinity (SEAICE_salt0); Define the following
C     flag to consider (space & time) variable salinity: advected and forming
C     seaice with a fraction (=SEAICE_saltFrac) of freezing seawater salinity.
C- Note: SItracer also offers an alternative way to handle variable salinity.

C--   Tracers of ice and/or ice cover.

C--   Enable grease ice parameterization
C     The grease ice parameterization delays formation of solid
C     sea ice from frazil ice by a time constant and provides a
C     dynamic calculation of the initial solid sea ice thickness
C     HO as a function of winds, currents and available grease ice
C     volume. Grease ice does not significantly reduce heat loss
C     from the ocean in winter and area covered by grease is thus
C     handled like open water.
C     (For details see Smedsrud and Martin, 2014, Ann.Glac.)
C     Set SItrName(1) = 'grease' in namelist SEAICE_PARM03 in data.seaice
C     then output SItr01 is SItrNameLong(1) = 'grease ice volume fraction',
C     with SItrUnit(1) = '[0-1]', which needs to be multiplied by SIheff
C     to yield grease ice volume. Additionally, the actual grease ice
C     layer thickness (diagnostic SIgrsLT) can be saved.
C--   grease ice uses SItracer:

C--   Historically, the seaice model was discretized on a B-Grid. This
C     discretization should still work but it is not longer actively tested
C     and supported. The following flag should always be set in order to use
C     the operational C-grid discretization.

C--   Only for the C-grid version it is possible to
C     enable advection of sea ice momentum
C     enable JFNK code by defining the following flag
C     enable Krylov code by defining the following flag
C     enable this flag to reproduce old verification results for JFNK
C     enable LSR to use global (multi-tile) tri-diagonal solver
C     enable EVP code by defining the following flag
C--   When set use SEAICE_zetaMin and SEAICE_evpDampC to limit viscosities
C     from below and above in seaice_evp: not necessary, and not recommended
C     smooth regularization (without max-function) of delta for
C     better differentiability
C     regularize zeta to zmax with a smooth tanh-function instead
C     of a min(zeta,zmax). This improves convergence of iterative
C     solvers (Lemieux and Tremblay 2009, JGR). No effect on EVP
C     allow the truncated ellipse rheology (runtime flag SEAICEuseTEM)
C     allow using a damage parameter that records violations of a Mohr
C     Coulomb criterion for stress
C     allow Maxwell Elasto-Brittle rheology (runtime flat SEAICEuseMEB);
C     the MEB code re-uses a lot of the VP code and can be used together
C     with all implicit solvers, although the parameter tuning requires
C     some care and not all combinations give satisfactory results; you need
C     an accurate solution of the momentum equations to reduce the amount
C     of error accumulation
C     MEB always needs the damage field
C     Use LSR vector code; not useful on non-vector machines, because it
C     slows down convergence considerably, but the extra iterations are
C     more than made up by the much faster code on vector machines. For
C     the only regularly test vector machine these flags a specified
C     in the build options file SUPER-UX_SX-8_sxf90_awi, so that we comment
C     them out here.
C     Use zebra-method (alternate lines) for line-successive-relaxation
C     This modification improves the convergence of the vector code
C     dramatically, so that is may actually be useful in general, but
C     that needs to be tested. Can be used without vectorization options.
C     Use parameterisation of grounding ice for a better representation
C     of fastice in shallow seas

C--   When set limit the Ice-Loading to mass of 1/5 of Surface ocean grid-box
C--   When set use SEAICE_clipVelocties = .true., to clip U/VICE at 40cm/s,
C     not recommended
C--   When set cap the sublimation latent heat flux in solve4temp according
C     to the available amount of ice+snow. Otherwise this term is treated
C     like all of the others -- residuals heat and fw stocks are passed to
C     the ocean at the end of seaice_growth in a conservative manner.
C     SEAICE_CAP_SUBLIM is not needed as of now, but kept just in case.

C--   Enable the adjointable sea-ice thermodynamic model
C     uses seaice_growth_adx.F and seaice_solve4temp_adx.F

C--   Enable free drift code

C--   pkg/seaice cost functions compile flags
c       >>> Sea-ice volume (requires pkg/cost)
c       >>> Sea-ice misfit to obs (requires pkg/cost and ecco)
